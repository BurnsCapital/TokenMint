# TokenMint
Token & ICO Generator for Ethereum Classic (ETC) and Ethereum (ETH)

This is simple to use token and ICO generator created for use with the Ethereum blockchains ETC & ETH. The purpose of this generator is to make it simple for users to create their own token and crowdsale using smart contracts.  Tokens are effectively a virtual currency created and secured on top of the Ethereum blockchain. An ICO is an Intial Coin Offering. At a designated price, users can offer their tokens at a set price in either ETC or ETH.  This can be useful for raising funds in a crowdsale. Tokens can be used in a variety of ways, user rewards, rebates, virtual currencies, or as a voting mechanism with a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).

What is the process like?

1. Preparation

Decide which account you wish all your free money to go to & ensure you have multiple backups of that account.
Decide the maximum amount of ETC you are willing to make from your scam (your Number of tokens). Ensure that account has 0.01 ETC for gas.
Start thinking of a name! The less vowels the better. Be sure to use j's, z's, and as many q's as you can . this is an important step
Do a roadshow! This means spam everyones slack, wechat, telegram and twitter relentlessly. Email people on lists you bought on the darknet or scraped from slack. Post an ANN on btctal. Really make everyone think that your product needs a token somehow instead of just using bitcoin or ether.
- 2. Launch a token

Make your magicERC20 token. The code is open to review so you wont be blamed for the 10's of thousands that get lost due to a bug that could be fixed with using the simple fix in EIP223
You will enter the Token name, Actual number of tokens, Token symbol for trading on markets, and the decimal places.
That's it! load your wallet and move on the crowd sale! (Now is a good time to go test drive a new lambo, your doing great.)

3. Crowdfunding

THIS IS WHERE THE REAL MAGIC HAPPENS!
You will unlock your account, enter the price per token, and the fundraising goal.

Use at your own risk US financial regulations are very strict on how funds can and can not be raised. You are not clever because you are being sneaky and using the blockchain, scammers have been doing the same thing for 100 years.

Even though you may not live in the USA. Through international treaties, that doesnt matter if you are still soliciting to its citizens. Your conuntry most likely has similar laws you are violiating such as anti-spamming and reporting rules.
